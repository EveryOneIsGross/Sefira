This project is a chatbot that uses the OpenAI API and the concept of sefira to generate answers and reflections for any question. A sefira is one of the 10 attributes or emanations of God in Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism1. The chatbot can traverse the tree of sefirot and answer questions based on the worldview of each sefira. It also uses pyttsx3, a text-to-speech library, to speak the final reflection.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the following libraries:

openai
random
pyttsx3
collections
You can install them using pip:

pip install openai random pyttsx3 collections
Copy
You also need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one from here.

Usage
To use this project, you need to enter your OpenAI API key when prompted. Then, you can enter any question you want to ask the chatbot. The chatbot will start at Malkuth, the lowest sefira, and traverse the tree of sefirot until it reaches Keter, the highest sefira. It will generate an answer and a clarification for each sefira, and a final reflection based on all the answers. It will also speak the final reflection using text-to-speech.

For example, if you ask “What is love?”, you might get something like this:

Starting at Malkuth...

Reflection:
Love is a multifaceted phenomenon that can be experienced and expressed in different ways depending on our level of consciousness and awareness. Each sefira offers a unique lens through which we can understand and appreciate love in its various forms and manifestations. By exploring these different aspects of love, we can enrich our lives and relationships, as well as connect to our true essence and purpose.

Limitations
This project has some limitations that you should be aware of:

The answers and reflections are generated by an AI model, which means they are not always accurate or reliable. They should not be taken as authoritative or definitive sources of information or wisdom.
The concept of sefira is based on Kabbalah, which is a complex and esoteric system of Jewish mysticism. This project does not claim to represent or explain Kabbalah in its entirety or authenticity. It only uses some basic ideas and terms from Kabbalah as a framework for generating responses.
The project relies on external sources (such as OpenAI API) and internal models (such as sefirot) to generate responses. This means that it may not always work as expected or produce consistent results. It also means that it may require internet connection and API access to function properly.
