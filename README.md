This project is a chain of thought chatbot that uses OpenAI API and the concept of sefira on the Tree of Life to generate answers and an enriched summarised reflection for any question. A sefira is one of the 10 attributes or emanations of God in Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism. The chatbot automatically traverses the tree of life asking the same question of each sefirot seeking answers based on their worldview and temprement. Ultimately it reflects on all answers and gives a final answer.

## Relation to Tree of Thought

The tree of thought chain (ToT) is a new framework for language model inference that generalizes over the popular chain of thought (CoT) approach to prompting language models. ToT enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows language models to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. (ToL) isn't that, but inspired by it and other systems like AutoGPT and BabyAGI.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the following libraries:

openai
random
pyttsx3
collections

  `pip install openai random pyttsx3 collections`
  
  To install
  
  `git clone https://github.com/EveryOneIsGross/Sefirot.git`
  
  To run
  
  `cd Sefirot`
  `python Sefirot_example.py`

You also need to have an OpenAI API key. üíÖ

## Usage

You will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key. Then provide a question or task. Using the text-davinci-003 your question will start at Malkuth, and traverse the ToL with gpt-3.5-turbo now choosing the appropriate Sefira to question. After prompting Keter, a new agent will summarise and look for insights from each sefira, ending with a final reflection providing it's final answer using gpt-3.5-turbo.

## Current Implementation

This is very much just a proof of concept that renders ok results and illustrates the concept. Alot of the logic on pathfinding is a placeholder or just messy. Also the prompts and descriptions of the Sefirot are not yet well defined. 

## To do

‚úÖ Create a framework of the concept

‚úÖ Implement a version that walks the path and generates a final reflection

‚ùå Understand what I am doing

‚ùå Refine individual Sefira temprement, colour, output

‚ùå Create a better pathfinding logic when choosing best Sefira to consult next

‚ùå Add more tools such as longterm memory for Sefirot

‚ùå Improve UI.. make one

‚úÖ Have a TTS example that records answers and reflection as mp3 locally.
