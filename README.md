This project is a chatbot that uses the OpenAI API and the concept of sefira to generate answers and reflections for any question. A sefira is one of the 10 attributes or emanations of God in Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism1. The chatbot can traverse the tree of sefirot and answer questions based on the worldview of each sefira. It also uses pyttsx3, a text-to-speech library, to speak the final reflection.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the following libraries:

openai
random
pyttsx3
collections
You can install them using pip:

pip install openai random pyttsx3 collections
Copy
You also need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one from here.

Usage
To use this project, you need to enter your OpenAI API key when prompted. Then, you can enter any question you want to ask the chatbot. The chatbot will start at Malkuth, the lowest sefira, and traverse the tree of sefirot until it reaches Keter, the highest sefira. It will generate an answer and a clarification for each sefira, and a final reflection based on all the answers. It will also speak the final reflection using text-to-speech.
